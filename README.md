We will start with a prototype in python for the reward system (this is a very basic prototype designed for us to get used to the technologies on a basic level that we will be utilizing throughout this project like taiga.io, git, GitKraken, IDE's, some python (which probably wont be used after this but it is a good stary), etc).
